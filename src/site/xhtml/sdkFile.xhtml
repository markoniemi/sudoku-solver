	<p>The file contains 9 lines, reach representing a row in the
		puzzle. Empty cells are represented by a dot. Additional information
		is optionally present in separate lines, starting with a hash
		character, followed by a single letter that identifies the type of
		info:</p>
<pre> 
A = Author
D = Description
C = Comment
B = Date published
S = Source (name of newspaper, book or website)
L = Level
U = Source URL
</pre>
	<p>These additional lines are only recognized by SudoCue. Sadman
		sudoku also uses this format, but it does not recognize these entries.
